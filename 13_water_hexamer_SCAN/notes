SCAN: Strongly-Constrained and Appropriately-Normed meta-GGA

1. SCAN functional: intermediate VdW captured
    * In INCAR, specify:
	METAGGA = SCAN
	LASPH = T
	ADDGRID = T
    * Use PBE pseudopotential
    * POTCAR should contain (grep kinetic POTCAR):                   
	kinetic energy-density
	mkinetic energy-density pseudized
	kinetic energy density (partial)

2. SCAN+rVV10: add long range VdW 
    * Further add the following lines in the INCAR:
	LUSE_VDW = T
	BPARAM = 15.7
